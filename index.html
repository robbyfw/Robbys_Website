    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Sukho, a centuries-old village in Gujar Khan, carries within it the memory of trade, faith, and cultural exchange. 
      During the British colonial period, it rose as a flourishing grain market where farmers and merchants from surrounding 
      villages gathered to sell wheat, corn, and pulses. Its bazaars were alive with voices of traders, storytellers, and travelers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The village was originally known as <em>Sarna</em>, but was later renamed after Malik Sukho, a respected elder and community 
      figure whose shrine still draws reverence. Generations grew up listening to oral tales of bravery, wisdom, and the resilience 
      of the people who shaped Sukho’s destiny. The village became not just a trading hub, but also a meeting point of different 
      communities, ideas, and traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even today, the old pathways and surviving structures silently whisper stories of a glorious past that laid the foundation 
      for Sukho’s cultural and spiritual identity.
    </p>

  <section id="saints" class="content-section">
    <h2>Saints & Spiritual Heritage</h2>
    <p>
      In 1742, the arrival of Shaikh Saadi — lovingly remembered as Data Diwan — marked a turning point in Sukho’s spiritual journey. 
      His teachings of love, humility, and service spread across the region and attracted followers from far and wide. Along with him, 
      saints from the Qadiri, Chishti, and Naqshbandi orders enriched the soil of Sukho with Sufi thought and practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their shrines and gatherings became centers of harmony, where poetry, music, and faith merged into a unique spiritual culture. 
      These saints taught people to rise above divisions of caste and creed, leaving behind a legacy of tolerance and devotion 
      that still inspires the present generation.
    </p>

  <section id="sikhs" class="content-section">
    <h2>The Sikh Community</h2>
    <p>
      Before the partition of India, Sikhs played a vital role in shaping Sukho’s identity. Many Sikh families were 
      prosperous merchants, landlords, and skilled craftsmen. They controlled key areas of trade and agriculture, turning 
      Sukho into a strong economic hub. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their presence can still be felt through the architectural traces left behind — schools, mansions, and temples — 
      which once stood as proud symbols of their contribution. The Sikh community not only expanded the local economy 
      but also fostered a culture of learning and social progress.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="choubaras" class="content-section">
    <h2>Choubaras of Sukho</h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most iconic structures of Sukho’s past were the <em>Choubaras</em> — elegant two-story houses with large 
      balconies overlooking the streets. Built by wealthy Sikh merchants and local nobles, these homes combined strength with beauty. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Choubaras were not just residences, but also gathering places where families celebrated festivals, weddings, and 
      community events. They symbolized prosperity and culture, and although many have not survived the test of time, their 
      memory continues to decorate the imagination of Sukho’s people.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="today" class="content-section">
    <h2>Sukho Today</h2>
    <p>
      Today, Sukho is steadily growing with new schools, shops, and modern facilities, yet the essence of the village remains rooted 
      in its history. The stories of saints, the legacy of Sikh merchants, and the spiritual harmony of the past still influence 
      the values of its people. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sukho is not just a geographical location — it is a living chronicle of faith, culture, and resilience, where past and present 
      walk hand in hand.
