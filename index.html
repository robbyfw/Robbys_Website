    <p class="intro">
      Hi, I’m <span class="highlight">Muhammad Asim</span>, also widely known as <span class="highlight">Robby</span>.  
      I create <b>web projects</b> to share knowledge and design experiences.  
      From exploring the <span class="highlight">history of places</span> to building sites for <span class="highlight">organizations</span>,  
      this is my little corner of the web where my ideas come to life.

      <h2>🚀 My Vision</h2>
      <p>
        I want to make websites that are not only <span class="highlight">useful</span>  
        but also <span class="highlight">beautiful & interactive</span>.  
        Every project is a new step toward learning and sharing.
